# livefyre-poc

This is a ASP.NET web app template generated by Visual Studio I've used to demonstrate the issue we are experiencing with LiveFyre.
The only files to look at are:

1. Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml : 
where Livefyre.js is included



2. Controllers/HomeController.cs :
where I followed http://answers.livefyre.com/developers/reference/generating-livefyre-tokens/ to generate Livefyre tokens in C#
step 4 in this tutorial may be of note, JWT.JsonWebToken is not a known field according to the most recent JWT package



3. Views/Home/Index.cshtml :
where we are attempting to initialize the comments plugin with the generated serverside tokens
